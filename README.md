# Hospital-Triage-System
A project simulating a hospital triage system using priority queues and heap-based ordering. Supports patient management with commands for adding, peeking, listing, and removing patients based on priority and arrival order. Developed during a Data Structures course as an introduction to heap structures and priority-based operations.
